## What is fortyfourforty?

We are a non-profit, co-operative, experimental land collective. "Experimentation" so far includes a free (as in currency) application structure in the virtual world and playing with flexible infrastructure and technology in the physical world. We're basically nothing in particular, really. But maybe we're becoming something in particular, with time.

If you would like to repair this website and the application process, contact us on Keybase: [https://keybase.io/team/4440.public](https://keybase.io/team/4440.public) ...there's a very good chance we won't do it ourselves. [Code exists](https://github.com/deobald/mombot). Database dump exists. We're just lazy.
